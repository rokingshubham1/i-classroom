# E-classroom
Its a fully integrated virtual classroom.
A platform for proper connectivity of students and teachers.
Here we have two different login options for students and teachers with there I'd and password.
Both of them have a different dashboards where teacher's have options to host classes, give assigments, conduct tests and evaluate performance of students.
Whereas students can attend classes, submit assignments and give tests. For the whole database Microsoft SQL sever is being used and we are using C# and ASP.NET for server side connections.
